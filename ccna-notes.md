# 🌐 Introduction to CCNA

**CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)** is an entry-level certification offered by Cisco that validates your knowledge of networking fundamentals, IP connectivity, network access, security, automation, and more. It's widely recognized and a solid stepping stone for a career in networking and IT infrastructure.

### 🎯 Purpose of CCNA:
- Validate foundational networking skills
- Prepare for real-world IT roles like Network Engineer, Support Technician, or System Administrator
- Build a strong base for advanced Cisco certifications (e.g., CCNP)

### 🔑 Key Domains Covered:
- 🌐 **Networking Fundamentals**
- 🔌 **IP Addressing & Subnetting**
- 🖧 **Routing & Switching Concepts**
- 🔐 **Network Security**
- ☁️ **Wireless & Cloud Fundamentals**
- 🤖 **Network Automation & Programmability**

### 📘 Example: IP Addressing

## 🧠 What is Networking?

**Networking** is the practice of connecting computers and other devices so they can share data and resources like files, printers, or internet access.

---

## 🔌 Why is Networking Important?

- 🌍 **Communication** – Allows systems to communicate locally or globally
- 📁 **Resource Sharing** – Share files, printers, or applications
- 🌐 **Internet Access** – Enables devices to connect to the web
- 💼 **Centralized Management** – Manage systems from one place in a business or enterprise

## 🧱 Basic Components of a Network

| Component     | Description                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Host**      | A device like a computer, phone, or printer that connects to the network |
| **Router**    | Connects multiple networks together (like your home to the internet) |
| **Switch**    | Connects devices within the same network (LAN)               |
| **Modem**     | Converts digital data to signals over telephone or cable     |
| **IP Address**| A unique number assigned to each device on a network         |

## 📂 Types of Networks

| Type      | Description                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **LAN**   | Local Area Network – limited to small areas like homes or offices |
| **WAN**   | Wide Area Network – spans large geographical areas (e.g., the internet) |
| **MAN**   | Metropolitan Area Network – covers cities    |
| **PAN**   | Personal Area Network – small range, e.g., Bluetooth |

## ✅ Summary

- Networking connects devices to **communicate** and **share resources**.
- It uses **hardware** (routers, switches) and **protocols** (like IP).
- Understanding these basics is essential before learning IP addressing, subnetting, and configurations in CCNA.
